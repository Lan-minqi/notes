> Concurrency is when two or more tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods. 
> It doesn't necessarily mean they'll ever both be running at the same instant. For example, multitasking on a single-core machine.

> Parallelism is when tasks literally run at the same time, e.g., on a multicore processor.
